These documents capture:
- Setup processes and troubleshooting steps specific to the original development environment
- Implementation decisions and architecture discussions
- Development roadmap and progress tracking
- Platform-specific configuration notes (WSL, PostgreSQL versions, etc.)
- Personal development notes and "fishing expedition" logs

- **[Main README.md](../../README.md)** - Project overview, quick start, and usage
- **[DEVELOPMENT.md](../../DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Development setup guide (recommended methods only)
